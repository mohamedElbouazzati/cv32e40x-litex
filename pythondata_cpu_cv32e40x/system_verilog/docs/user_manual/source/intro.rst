.. note::

   |corev| does not implement the **F** extension for single-precision floating-point instructions internal to the core. The **F** extension
   can be supported by interfacing the |corev| to an external FPU via the eXtension interface.

Most content of the RISC-V privileged specification is optional.
|corev| currently supports the following features according to the RISC-V Privileged Specification [RISC-V-PRIV]_.

* M-Mode
* All CSRs listed in :ref:`cs-registers`
* Base Counters, Timers and Hardware Performance Counters as described in :ref:`performance-counters` controlled by the ``NUM_MHPMCOUNTERS`` parameter
* Trap handling supporting direct mode or vectored mode as described at :ref:`exceptions-interrupts`
* Physical Memory Attribution (PMA) as described in :ref:`pma`

Synthesis guidelines
--------------------

The |corev| core is fully synthesizable.
It has been designed mainly for ASIC designs, but FPGA synthesis
is supported as well.

All the files in the ``rtl`` and ``rtl/include`` folders are synthesizable. The top level module is called ``cv32e40x_core``.

The user must provide a clock-gating module that instantiates
the clock-gating cells of the target technology. This file must have the same interface and module name of the one provided for simulation-only purposes
at ``bhv/cv32e40x_sim_clock_gate.sv`` (see :ref:`clock-gating-cell`).

The ``constraints/cv32e40x_core.sdc`` file provides an example of synthesis constraints. No synthesis scripts are provided.

ASIC Synthesis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ASIC synthesis is supported for |corev|. The whole design is completely
synchronous and uses positive-edge triggered flip-flops. A technology specific implementation
of a clock gating cell as described in :ref:`clock-gating-cell` needs to
be provided.

FPGA Synthesis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FPGA synthesis is supported for |corev|. The user needs to provide
a technology specific implementation of a clock gating cell as described
in :ref:`clock-gating-cell`.

Verification
------------

The verification environment (testbenches, testcases, etc.) for the |corev|
core can be found at  `core-v-verif <https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif>`_.
It is recommended that you start by reviewing the
`CORE-V Verification Strategy <https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
